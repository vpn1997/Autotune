# AutoVolume

Intro:
Auto Volume is an app that senses the surrounding sound intensity and changes the phone's ringing, calling and media volume according to it. 

# About App Features: 

1.It tunes the ringing, calling and media volume according to the surrounding sound intensity.

2.It can also alter the media volume, so you can enjoy your music whenever you want to, wherever you want to.

3.Runs in background, and you  can always tune volume manually, by disabling our app after opening it from the notification bar, which will be there permanently.

4.It can also control the media volume, when the user is listening to music using earphones, just as it did in the 2nd point.

5.The app won't work when the user has enabled silent or vibrate only profiles.

6.The app takes the average of surrounding sounds over a time interval of 7s.

7.Some features might not work in some phones (redmi note 3), and we are looking forward to resolve this issue.

# Upgrades:

1.We would like to add a new parameter, that is, sensitivity. This would rule out the case when the client wants the app to work, but even in the presence of high background noises, he would like the ringing and media to not be at the max level.

2.You would be able to change the time interval over which Auto Volume takes the average to alter the phone volumes.

# Installation Instructions:

Upon installation give the app access to everything it needs, if you don't it won't run, but you can always do it from the settings. Min. SDK required to run it is 19, and the targeted SDK is 23(Marshmellow 6.0).

# Usage Instructions:

If you are trying to use an app that will use the mic, so better, switch off Auto Volume by opening the app from the notification bar, because as we all know that the mic can be utilized by only one app at a time.
